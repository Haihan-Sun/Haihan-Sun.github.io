    Teaching is one of the main driving forces behind my pursuit of an academic career.
    I genuinely enjoy working with students - seeing the curiosity and enthusiasm in their eyes,
    and helping them achieve their goals step by step is incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.
    Also, selfishly speaking, for me, teaching is probably the best way to learn ðŸ˜„

  <p>
    Engineering is a fascinating field where scientific theory meets real-world application.
    My teaching philosophy is best captured by <strong>APPLY</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>A</strong> â€“ Acquire theoretical knowledge</li>
    <li><strong>P</strong> â€“ Practice through hands-on experience</li>
    <li><strong>P</strong> â€“ Pursue innovation and creative problem-solving</li>
    <li><strong>L</strong> â€“ Link theory to real-world engineering challenges</li>
    <li><strong>Y</strong> â€“ Yield continuous growth for the future</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I strive to create an engaging learning environment by integrating theoretical content with simulations,
    animations, and lab demonstrations, while creating opportunities for students to teach their peers and me ðŸ˜‰
    I have greatly enjoyed teaching over the past few semesters and am grateful to have had many highly motivated
    and talented students in my class. I look forward to continuing to explore effective teaching practices
    and to learning and growing alongside my students.

  <strong> Teaching Materials </strong> <br>
    <br>
   Most of my teaching slides can be accessed below. These slides were prepared to help students follow along and take notes during class. They are updated annually through an iterative process to improve engagement and alignment with student learning needs. <br>

    <i>Acknowledgments</i>: My sincere thanks to the educators who have inspired and supported the development of these teaching materials. Portions of the slides for ECE 320 and ECE 420 were prepared with reference to instructional resources from Professor Cynthia Furse at the University of Utah and Professor Xudong Chen at the National University of Singapore. The slides for ECE 841 were prepared and adapted from materials generously shared by Professor Nader Behdad at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.   <br>
