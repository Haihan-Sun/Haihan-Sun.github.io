Hi! I'm Haihan Sun, a postdoctoral research fellow at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I received my B. Eng from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2015, and Ph.D. from the University of Technology Sydney in 2019. My research interests include <a href="https://haihan-sun.github.io/BSA/"  style="color:#35866F">Base Station Antenna</a> and <a href="https://haihan-sun.github.io/GPR/"  style="color:#35866F"> Ground Penetrating Radar</a>.
